// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Figure out what is needed to build the project. 'What resources (example: cost, team, technologies, etc.) will be required to impliment this?'"
const design = "Creating the scope of work needed to impliment the project. 'How will we get what we want?' Plan of how it will be executed."
const implimentation = "Executing plans and building the program."
const testingAndIntegration = "Q&A is done. Software is tried and tested to make sure it is all working appropriately."
const maintain = "Upkeep. Regular maintanence of the end result or product. Fixing any bugs that come up. "
